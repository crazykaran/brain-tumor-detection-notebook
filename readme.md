# BRAIN TUMER DETECTION JUPYTER NOTEBOOK

## Overview

This IPython Notebook contains the implementation of our machine learning model for brain tumor detection. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and trained on a dataset of MRI images.

## Usage

To use the machine learning model:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary libraries and dependencies installed.

2. **Open the Notebook**: Open the `tumordetection.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. **Run the Notebook Cells**: Execute the notebook cells to load the pre-trained model, perform any necessary data preprocessing steps, and make predictions on new MRI images.

4. **Interpret Results**: Interpret the model predictions and use them to make informed decisions.

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: The model architecture is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
- **Training Data**: The model was trained on a dataset of MRI images labeled with tumor and non-tumor classes.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The model's performance was evaluated using various parameters.
- **Performance**: The model achieved an accuracy of 96.83% on the validation set and showed good generalization performance.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure that you have GPU support enabled if you're training the model on a large dataset to speed up training.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters and model architectures to improve performance.
- Feel free to reach out to the project maintainers if you encounter any issues or have questions about the model or notebook.
